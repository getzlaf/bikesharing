# bikesharing

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to see how people from New York City use the Citi Bikesharing system. We also look for how this system could perform in Des Moines, Iowa. 

### Results

First, we break down who use this system the most. As we can see below, the men use the bikesharing more than the women.

Fourth, on this chart below, we see that the most popular days for women are Thursday, Friday and Saturday. For men it's Thursday, Friday and Tuesday. Further investigation might help us understand why Tuesdays are more popular than Saturdays for men.

### Summary

As we can see, people mostly use the bikes to go and to comeback from work. They use them less than a hour per checkout and people also like to use them on the weekends. However, it is New York City so on the weekends we might expect a lot of tourists who use the bikes. Further research might guide us to see if it's the subscribers or the one time users who use the bikes the most on the weekends. We would also like to know the distance the people do with the bikes per checkout. It could guide us to see where bike stations need to be in Des Moines.
